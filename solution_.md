Analysis: 
Both series were standardized to z-score to see the trend, making them easy to compare. The plot shows that the increase of WO student number and beer consumption shows a similar trend. In consistent with this, the Pearson correlation of WO students number and beer consumption is 0.818, which shows a relatively high correlation.
